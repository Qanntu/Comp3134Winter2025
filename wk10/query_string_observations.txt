1) I typed security word in the form and submitted it
   - The page processed it correctly and showed results related to the word 

2) I typed a word that is not an English word in the URL  
   - the word was displayed on the screen without any validation 

3) I typed `<script>alert('hello')</script>` in the form and submitted it
    - The page executed the script, displaying an alert box with hello. This confirms that the page is vulnerable to XSS 	because it does not sanitize user input. 

4) I added `<script>alert('hello')</script>` in the URL
   - The page executed the script and displayed an alert box saying hello
   - so,  is vulnerable to XSS because it does not sanitize user input
