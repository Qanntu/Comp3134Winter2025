Encryption would prevent this exposure issue by converting the data into a secure and unreadable format so it doesn't become accessible to any attacker. Sending a request from HTTP would mean the data being sent would be plaintext, which means there's no security surrounding that data. On the other hand, HTTPS uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to convert private and sensitive data into a form which would be unreadable to attackers. The recipient would then be able to decrypt this unreadable form using a specific key embedded within their system. With the help of encryption, it would prevent data breaches and identity theft. Because of this, the more preferable route many websites and application utilize nowadays is the HTTPS due to the protection it has with containing private information secure.
