ARP spoofing attacks work by the attacker sending forged ARP packets that tamper with the MAC address of the target IP address. There are several security measures we can use to mitigate this. First, we can use Static ARP, a configuration method that manually binds the MAC to the IP address to prevent unauthorized changes to the IP-MAC mapping. Second, we can use DHCP snooping on the network switches. After enabling, it will retain the MAC address of each computer, which can filter untrusted DHCP messages and help detect and block malicious ARP packets. Third, we can use a Virtual Private Network. By using a VPN, data is encapsulated and encrypted to ensure that attackers cannot decrypt the data even if they intercept the traffic.
